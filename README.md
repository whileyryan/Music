## About DiscoMuse
DiscoMuse is an application meant to fill the void that exists in the music web-verse. It is a musical discovery tool and
meant to inspire you to explore different genres. Although, there are plenty of websites that stream music and videos as well as
an infinite amount of websites which review everything from a musician's nail polish color to the use of a particular type of
EQing, DiscoMuse offers insight in to the experience of live performance as a spectator. It was created with the intention to
help the everyman, college student, or mom who has limited free time and funds. Whether you are interested in an obscure
band, a pop princess, a r&B mogul or a new EDM dj, DiscoMuse offers you access to peer reviews on any live performance and we
will then ask you how was the show? What was it like? How was the music? Contribute as much or as little as you want but come
back.

## About ShowB4youGo
ShowB4youGo is an application meant to fill the void that exists in the music web-verse. Although,
there are plenty of websites that stream music and videos as well as an infinite amount of websites which
review everything from a musician's nail polish color to the use of a particular type of EQing, ShowB4youGo offers insight into
the experience of live performance. It was created with the intention to help the everyman, college student, or 
mom who has limited free time and funds, yet still very interested in the music scene whether it be an obscure band, a pop 
princess, a r&B mogul or a new EDM dj. ShowB4youGo offers you access to peer reviews on these sorts of performances, asking you 
what you thought, what was the atmosphere like, how was the music. Contribute as much or as little as you want.
